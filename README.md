# HOMEWORK#3: WORK DAY SCHEDULER
### NICCI MOYER


## HOW TO

To operate the day planner, simply open the index.html in your default browser. 
The current hour will be highlighted in red. Future hours will be green, while past hours will be grey. To input data into the text area, simply type your text and click save!

NOTE: The local storage piece of the project is what I struggled with the most. I was not able to set it up so that the text remains when the page is refreshed. 


## BUILT WITH

This application was built using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, and moment.
